In the given code, elements is a string array of all the keys in the composition map. Each iteration of the for loop selects one element from the elements array and sets its composition in the scheil_calculation object.

The method set_composition is called on the scheil_calculation object with two arguments: the first argument element is the string name of the element being set, and the second argument is the weight percentage composition of that element in the current phase.

In the loop, the element variable takes on the value of each element name in the elements array, and the corresponding weight percentage is obtained from the composition map using the element variable as a key. This weight percentage composition value is then passed as the second argument to the set_composition method along with the element name as the first argument.

Overall, this loop is responsible for setting the composition of each element in the scheil_calculation object based on the weight percentage data provided in the composition map.
