MatLab and TC Coding drafts

So I have not put in any error handling. I am going to work on that next.

I tested it for 5 different compositions (they have to be the same database and elements). Your code should go in the thermocalc folder, mine goes here:

C:\Users\Public\Documents\Thermo-Calc\2022a\SDK\TC-Toolbox-MATLAB\Users\ahansen\TestCode\SchielTestCode

So, I think the important folder is: 

C:\Users\Public\Documents\Thermo-Calc\2022a\SDK\TC-Toolbox-MATLAB\

For MatLab to communicate. Also you need the toolkit installed. Which if you haven’t done then that’s a discussion. 

Anyways… the excel sheet should be:
-First row are your elements, you can technically have as many as you want, but the LAST COLUMN is the dependent element.
-Subsequent rows should be your compositions

I think I have comments everywhere in the code.
