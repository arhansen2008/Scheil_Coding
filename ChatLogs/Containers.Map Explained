Can you explain the follow line of code. Specifically "containers.map"

composition = containers.Map(elementlist, comps);


The line of code composition = containers.Map(elementlist, comps); creates a new object called composition of the class containers.Map.

containers.Map is a built-in MATLAB class that implements a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and the value is associated with that key.

In this line of code, the elementlist variable is used as the keys, and the comps variable is used as the corresponding values for the hash table. This means that if you want to look up the composition for a particular element, you can use the element name as the key to look up the corresponding weight percentage in the comps variable.

For example, if you wanted to look up the weight percentage of silicon in the composition, you could use the following code:

makefile
Copy code
silicon_pct = composition("Si");
This would retrieve the weight percentage of silicon from the hash table.
